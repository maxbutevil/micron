# Micron
Micron is a tiny state management/web framework. Under the hood, it uses SnabbDOM to manipulate the DOM, but Micron is what handles all of the state management and updates.
I made Micron partly as a learning experience, and partly because React was poorly suited to my extremely specific use case - a web game with extremely complex state.
I've learned a lot since I first started working on Micron, and I probably wouldn't use it in a project today (I'd use SolidJS or React, in that order).
